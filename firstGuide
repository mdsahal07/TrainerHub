### **1. Prioritize the Features for MVP**
Focus only on the following critical features for the MVP:
- **User Authentication (login/signup)** for both clients and trainers.
- **Profile Management** (clients and trainers can create and update their profiles).
- **Trainer Search** (clients can search for trainers and see basic details).
- **Video Calls** (using Jitsi or a similar API to allow video sessions).
- **Basic Feedback & Rating System** (clients can leave feedback after a session).
- **Admin Dashboard** (for basic user management).

### **2. Revised Development Phases**

#### **Week 1: Backend Setup & User Authentication**
1. **Set Up Backend (Node.js + Express)**:
   - Initialize the project and set up the Express server.
   - Set up **MongoDB** (use MongoDB Atlas if you're short on time).
   - Implement **JWT Authentication** for clients and trainers.
   - Create models for `User` (with roles as "client" or "trainer") and user profile data (e.g., name, email, password, username).
   - Implement **login** and **signup** routes, and test them.

2. **Frontend Setup (React + Vite)**:
   - Set up the frontend with **Vite + React**.
   - Set up **React Router** for page navigation.
   - Create **login** and **signup** pages.
   - Implement **profile creation/editing** for clients and trainers.
   - Connect frontend with backend for authentication.

**Milestone:** Basic authentication is functional and profiles can be created/updated.

#### **Week 2: Trainer Search and Basic Profile Management**
1. **Trainer Search Feature**:
   - Create a **trainer search page** where clients can filter trainers by type, rating, or other factors.
   - Build **trainer profile pages** where clients can see qualifications, experience, and availability.
   - Implement basic **search filters** (rating, trainer type).

2. **Progress Tracker (Basic)**:
   - Start implementing **progress tracking** for clients (e.g., workout tracker, BMR calculator).
   - Set up simple **food logging** for clients to track their daily intake (optional if time allows).

**Milestone:** Trainer search is functional, and clients can view basic trainer profiles.

---

#### **Week 3: Video Call Integration & Feedback System**
1. **Integrate Video Calls (Jitsi)**:
   - Integrate **Jitsi Meet API** for video calls between clients and trainers.
   - Set up scheduling for video calls and allow both parties to join via a unique link.

2. **Feedback & Rating System**:
   - Implement the ability for **clients to leave feedback and rate trainers** after sessions.
   - Store feedback and display average ratings on trainer profiles.

**Milestone:** Video calls are operational, and feedback/rating system works.

---

#### **Week 4: Admin Dashboard & Final Touches**
1. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Implement basic **admin authentication**.
   - Allow admins to manage **user roles** (approve trainers, delete users if needed).
   - Display basic stats (e.g., number of trainers, client feedback, etc.).

2. **Testing & Deployment**:
   - Test all features thoroughly.
   - Focus on **basic usability** to make sure the app is functional for both clients and trainers.
   - Deploy backend (using **Heroku** or **Vercel**) and frontend (using **Netlify** or **Vercel**).
   - Ensure everything works together seamlessly.

**Milestone:** Admin dashboard is functional, and the app is deployed.

### **3. Additional Tips**
- **Keep it simple**: Since you have a limited time frame, aim for **basic functionality** rather than perfect design. Focus on getting the core features right.
- **Use templates**: For parts of the UI (like the profile pages or feedback system), consider using **Material UI** or **Tailwind CSS** to speed up development.
- **API-first**: Focus on making sure that your backend APIs (authentication, trainer profiles, video call links, feedback) are solid before worrying too much about frontend styling.
- **Avoid feature creep**: Stick to the core features that are absolutely necessary for the MVP. Don’t get distracted by nice-to-have features like advanced progress tracking or workout/diet plans for now.
